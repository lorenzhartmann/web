        <h1>To my friends in the Cambridge Assassins' Guild</h1>
        <p>Hello dear reader. You are probably on this webpage because you are part of a wonderful Cambridge-wide game, aiming to hunt down as many unsuspecting players as possible, 
        going down in the history books with the title "Master Assassin" (If not, you are probably very confused right now. Don't worry, it's all just a lot of fun).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have to tell you that you made one mistake: choosing me as a target. I am one with the shadows. You will never find me. And even if you do, I will be prepared.</p>
        <p>The good news are: Your time on this website has not been wasted entirely. On this website, I have left a secret message somewhere for you to find. Maybe you will it if you just take a look around 
            <a href="#" title="Okay, nice idea, but no." style="text-decoration: none;">here</a>.<!-- Okay, well done. It seems like I can't get you off my tail! I guess we have to end this the old-fashioned way: by a duel
            of honour! Send me a message on discord to pontus1785 with a proposal.-->
