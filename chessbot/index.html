        <h1>Coding a Chess Robot from scratch</h1>
        <p>Please meet Robot J. Fischer, a chess bot I coded from scratch in Python! On this page, you can find out how Robot J. Fischer was built, and how you can test it (and your chess skills) online. This project is a coding challenge I set out to complete when I caught a cold in June 2025. 
            My original goal was to code a bot that would be able to beat me at chess - we'll see how that turned out below. </p>
        <p> When I decided to tackle this project, there were a few decisions (or design choices) I made: </p>
                <ul><li>The bot had to be coded entirely by me in Python - no endgame tables, online ressources or opening books.</li>
                <li>I would not look at instructions online, or research how chess bots are usually implemented. 
                    Admittedly, I was not entirely new to the topic since I knew stories of people completing similar projects before, and I did use online ressources when I got stuck. But I figured that it
                    would still be more fun to go in blind and develop my own concepts, instead of merely implementing methods others have used long before me.</li>
                <li>I want to teach the bot to play chess like a human. Robot J. Fischer needs to learn the same basic chess principles we teach to every chess beginner, and it should not contain any unnatural methods like piece-square-tables</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h2>The first steps</h2>
        <p>It quickly became clear to me that the heart of my bot had to be some kind of evaluation function. This function performs a stratetic (rather than tactical) assessment of a given board and decides how good (or bad) this position is for either player.</p>
            <img src="../objects/evaluate.png" style="width: 20%;" alt="Concept of an evaluation function">
        <p>This function was the first thing I worked on. The challenge is to find the right metrics that make a chess position good for either color, and to find a way to implement them in Python in a computationally efficient way.
            The obvious starting point is the current material count, but I kept editing this function during the whole coding process to account for more factors that a human chess player would also consider:
            <ul>
                <li>How much space (= how many legal moves) each side has</li>
                <li>How well each side defends their pieces and attacks the opponents</li>
                <li>If there are any passes pawns, or pawns close to promotion</li>
                <li>How save (= close to the corner) every king is, except during the endgame</li>
                <li>During the opening phase: How well each side occupies the center with pawns develops their pieces and whether they moved their king</li>
                <li>During the final moves of the game: How well the own king is activated and the opponent's king is forced to the corner</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Based on this evaluation function, we can already set up a minimal working example of a chess bot: Given a position, go through every legal move and play the one that maximizes the evaluation function (or minimizes it, if you are playing with the black pieces)
            Of course, this bot has a profound weakness: It cannot take the opponent's responses into account. For example, if will gladly sacrifice its queen to take your pawn, as this move will momentarily boost the evaluation in its favour.
