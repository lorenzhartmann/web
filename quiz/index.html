        <h1>Quiz</h1>
        <p>So you think you are good with geography? Test your skills in this quiz that challenges your knowledge and intuition about cities and languages all over the world.</p>
        <img src="/objects/quizfeature.png" width="500">
        <p>The rules are simple: You are shown 10 city names, and its up to you to guess where these cities may be located on the world map. The closer you are to the correct answer, the better!
        And don't worry that the game will be too easy or too hard: you can choose between three levels of difficulty.</p>
        <p>You can try this game on your own device by downloading the zip below and executing the "main.exe" file.</p>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-file fa-lg"></i> <a href="/objects/geographyquiz.7z" download>Download zip file</a>
        <p>Unfortunately, this game is currently only available in German, but the rules and mechanics should be fairly self-explanatory.<br>
        Good luck and have fun! I'm excited to see your personal highscores.</p>
