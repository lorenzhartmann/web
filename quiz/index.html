        <p>The rules are simple: You are shown 10 city names, and its up to you to guess where these cities may be located on the world map. The closer you are to the correct answer, the better!
        And don't worry that the game will be too easy or too hard: you can choose between three levels of difficulty.</p> 
        <p>If you are not convinced yet, this game does also have a fun connection to physics: To determine the precise distance between two points on the world map, the game displays the shortest geodesic between your guess and the correct answer and calculates the length of that geodesic.
