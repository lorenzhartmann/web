        <h1>Quantum Cosmology</h1>
        <p>Quantum Cosmology is an exciting branch of theoretical physics that applies the principles of quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole. It seeks to explain the beginning and early evolution 
            of the universe in a way that incorporates both the principles of 
            quantum theory and general relativity, which makes it an important testbed for candidate theories of quantum gravity.</p>
        <p>
        I got to know Quantum Cosmology in depth during my Bachelor's thesis, and in the future I plan to fill this page with more information and explanations about this fascinating field. 
        In the meantime, you can browse the slides from a presentation I gave on the topic If you’d like to discuss the presentation, Quantum Cosmology, or simply share thoughts, please don’t hesitate to reach out — I’d love to hear from you!
