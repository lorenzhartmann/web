        <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br>
        I'm Lorenz Hartmann, a theoretical physics student currently based in Cambridge (UK), trying to make sense of the world one equation at a time.</p>

        <p>But I promise, I am interested in many other things as well! One of my favourite hobbies seems to be acquiring new hobbies, so no matter what you're into, chances are we will have some interest in common.</p>
        <p>This website is a work in progress - I will do my best to add new content regularly and keep it up to date. Right now, you can:
            <ul>
                <!-- <li>Read about Quantum Cosmology and my bachelor's thesis</li> -->
                <li>Learn more about my attempt to code a bot that can beat me at chess, and find out how you can play against this bot online</li>
                <li>Discover the most exciting and beautiful places I have travelled to</li>
                <li>Download and play a fun geography quiz I designed</li>
                <li>Get in touch with me and follow me on social media</li>
            </ul>
        While we are on the topic, I feel the need to apologize that this website looks like it was designed in the 90s. I promise, it wasn't - this is just due to my poor CSS skills.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore, and if anything catches your interest, let's connect!
